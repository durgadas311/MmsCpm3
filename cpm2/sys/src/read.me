This disk contains the BIOS source for Magnolia Microsystem's implementation
of Digital Research's CP/M v2 operating system for the Heath/Zenith Z89/Z90
microcomputer.

Each diskio.ASM file contains a relocation bit-map at the end which MUST be
revised if ANY changes are made in the program code.

Discussions of the relocation technique used by MOVCPM may be found in the
literature.

The source files for two system utilities, MODE and FORMAT, are also included.
