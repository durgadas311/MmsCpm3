This archive contains the relevant files for the missing DEFSASI3.COD image.

This was produced by splitting M320'3.ASM into two parts, first is the
part that DEFSASI3 configures/creates and second is the non-configurable
part that DEFSASI3 adds to make a complete SASI driver module.

m320fxd3.asm	This is the equivalent part that DEFSASI3 configures.
		This file is here only to complete the picture, but can
		be used to manually configure a SASI driver if need be.

			[edit m320fxd3.asm for configuration]
			RMAC M320FXD3.ASM
			LINK BNKSIO3=...,M320FXD3,M320COD3,...

m320cod3.asm	This is the non-configurable part of the driver, used
		to create DEFSASI3.COD.

m320-3.asm	This is the M320'3.ASM driver, modified to use the same
		symbols as required by DEFSASI3. It is handy for
		comparison checking that no significant changes were
		made to the others modules, for example using 'meld':

			meld m320cod3.asm m320-3.asm m320fxd3.asm

defsasi3.cod	This is the result of compiling and renaming m320cod3.asm:

			RMAC M320COD3.ASM
			REN DEFSASI3.COD=DEFSASI3.REL
