; H8/H89 Serial port configurations:
;   1 - Only console at 0E8H
;   2 - Console, plus "lp" at 0E0H
;   3 - Console+lp, plus "aux" at 0D0H
;   4 - Console+lp+aux, plus "modem" at 0D8H
; NOTE: on new Z80 CPU boards, "modem" is the USB modules and
; not an INS8250 UART. Also on these boards, "aux" or "lp" is
; chosen but not both. This software requires "lp" to be jumpered.
; "aux" is only usable on external (off-CPU) serial adapters.
