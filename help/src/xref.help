  ///1XREF

  Syntax:

          XREF {d:} filename {$P}

  Explanation:

  XREF provides  a  cross-reference  summary   of  variable   usage
  in   a   program.  XREF requires the .PRN and .SYM files produced
  by MAC or RMAC for input to the program.  The SYM and  PRN  files
  must  have  the same filename as the filename in the XREF command
  tail.  XREF outputs a file of type .XRF.

  Examples:

  A>XREF b:MYPROG

  A>XREF b:MYPROG $P
