  ///1SRVSTART

  Syntax:

      SRVSTART

  Explanation:

  The SRVSTART command releases the  CP/NET Server process and allows it
  to  begin  accepting  CP/NET  Client  requests.  If  this  command  is
  successful, the process NetServr should (mostly) show up as "Delaying"
  in the MPMSTAT output.

  Examples:

  0A>SRVSTART
