  ///1LOAD

  Syntax:

      LOAD filename

  Explanation:

  The LOAD Command generates a command file (filetype .COM)  from
  a   .HEX  input  file.  It  names  the  output file with the same
  filename as the input file but with filetype .COM.  LOAD always
  looks for a file with filetype .HEX.

  Example:

  A>LOAD B:PROGRAM

       Generates a command file PROGRAM.COM from the input hex file
       PROGRAM.HEX.
