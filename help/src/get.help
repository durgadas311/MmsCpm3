  ///1GET

  Syntax:

  GET {CONSOLE INPUT FROM} FILE filespec{[{ECHO|NO ECHO} | SYSTEM]}
  GET {CONSOLE INPUT FROM} CONSOLE

  Explanation:

  GET  directs the system to take console input from a file for the
  next system  command  or  user  program entered at the console.

  Console input  is  taken  from   a   file   until   the   program
  terminates.  If  the  file  is  exhausted before program input is
  terminated, the program  looks  for  subsequent  input  from  the
  console.  If  the  program  terminates  before exhausting all its
  input, the system reverts back to the console for console  input.

  With  the  SYSTEM  option,  the  system  immediately  goes to the
  specified file for console input.  The  system  reverts  to   the
  console   for  input  when it reaches the end of file.  Re-direct
  the system to the  console  for   console   input  with  the  GET
  CONSOLE INPUT FROM CONSOLE command as a command line in the input
  file.

  ///2Options

  ECHO      specifies that input is echoed to  the  console.   This
            is the default option.

  NO ECHO   specifies that  file   input   is  not  echoed  to  the
            console.  The program output and the system prompts are
            not affected by this option and are still   echoed   to
            the console.

  SYSTEM    specifies that all  system  input  is immediately taken
            from  the disk file specified in the command line.  GET
            takes system and program input from the file until  the
            file  is  exhausted  or  until  GET reads a GET console
            command from the file.

  ///2Examples

  A>GET FILE XINPUT
  A>MYPROG

       Tells the system to  activate the GET utility.  Since SYSTEM
       is  not specified, the system reads the next input line from
       the console and   executes   MYPROG.    If  MYPROG   program
       requires  console  input,  it is taken from the file XINPUT.
       When MYPROG terminates,  the  system  reverts  back  to  the
       console for console input.

  A>GET FILE XIN2 [SYSTEM]

       Immediately  directs   the   system    to    get  subsequent
       console  input from file XIN2 because it includes the SYSTEM
       option.  The system reverts  back   to   the   console   for
       console  input  when it reaches the end of file in XIN2.  Or
       XIN2 may redirect the system  back  to  the  console  if  it
       contains a  GET CONSOLE command.

  A>GET CONSOLE

       Tells the system to get console   input  from  the  console.
       This  command may be used in a file (previously specified in
       a GET FILE command), which is already  being  read   by  the
       system   for   console  input.  It is used  to re-direct the
       console input back to  the console  before the   end-of-file
       is reached.
