  ///1RENAME

  Syntax:

       RENAME {new-filespec=old-filespec}

  Explanation:

  RENAME lets you change the name of a  file in the directory of  a
  disk.  To  change several filenames in one command use the * or ?
  wildcards in the file specifications.  The RENAME command can  be
  abbreviated REN.  REN prompts you for input.

  ///2Examples

  A>RENAME NEWFILE.BAS=OLDFILE.BAS

       The file OLDFILE.BAS changes to NEWFILE.BAS on drive A.

  A>RENAME

  The system prompts for the filespecs:

          Enter New Name:X.PRN
          Enter Old Name:Y.PRN
          Y      .PRN=X        .PRN
          A>

  File X.PRN is renamed to Y.PRN on drive A.

  B>REN A:PRINTS.NEW = PRINCE.NEW

       The file PRINCE.NEW on drive  A  changes  to  PRINTS.NEW  on
       drive A.

  A>RENAME S*.TEX=A*.TEX

       The  above  command   renames   all   the   files   matching
       A*.TEX to files with filenames S*.TEX.

  A>REN B:NEWLIST=B:OLDLIST

       The file OLDLIST changes to NEWLIST on drive B.   Since  the
       second  drive specifier, B:  is implied by the first one, it
       is unnecessary in this example.  The command line above  has
       the same effect as the following:

          A>REN B:NEWLIST=OLDLIST
                     or
          A>REN NEWLIST=B:OLDLIST
