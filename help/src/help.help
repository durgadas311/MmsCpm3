  ///1HELP

  Syntax:

     HELP {topic} {subtopic1 ... subtopic8} {[NOPAGE|LIST]}

  Explanation:

  HELP  displays  a  list  of  topics   and   provides   summarized
  information for CP/M 3 commands.

  HELP topic displays information about that topic.
  HELP topic subtopic displays information about that subtopic.

  One or two letters is enough to identify the topics.  After  HELP
  displays   information   for   your  topic,   it   displays   the
  special  prompt  HELP> on your screen,  followed  by  a  list  of
  subtopics.

   -  Enter ? to display list of main topics.
   -  Enter a period and subtopic name to access subtopics.
   -  Enter a period to redisplay what you just read.
   -  Press the RETURN key to return to the CP/M 3 system prompt.
   -  Press any key to exit a display and return to the HELP> prompt.

  Option [LIST] disables the clearing of the screen between pages.

  Option [NOPAGE] disables the pause at the end of a page.

  Undocumented option [CREATE] causes the  file HELP.DAT to be processed
  into a new HELP.HLP. No help topics are displayed.

  Undocumented option  [EXTRACT] is the reverse  of [CREATE], generating
  HELP.DAT from HELP.HLP. No help topics are displayed.
