  ///1TPA

  Syntax:

      TPA

  Explanation:

  The TPA Command  displays the amount of memory  available for TPA.
  The amount of  memory is a direct translation of  the current BDOS
  entry  page,  including any  active  RSXs.  This  can be  used  to
  determine if RSXs are resident, by  comparing the TPA to the value
  seen immediately after boot.

  Example:

      A>TPA
      57.25K TPA
