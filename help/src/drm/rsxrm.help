  Syntax:

      RSXRM name

  Explanation:

  The RSXRM Command  instructs a cooperating RSX  to schedule itself
  for removal.  The target  RSX must  intercept and  understand BDOS
  function 60 with an RSX PB  FUNC of 113 and PARAMETER1 pointing to
  an 8-character  blank-padded string  representing the name  of the
  RSX to remove. If an RSX  is loaded multiple times, only the first
  instance will remove itself.

  Example:

      A>RSXRM NDOS3
