  ///1SUM

  Syntax:

      SUM filename

  Explanation:

  The SUM Command computes a checksum  for the contents of the specified
  file. The checksum computed is the BSD sum algorithm, using 1K blocks.

  The checksum includes  the entire contents of all records  in the file
  For  text files,  this  means bytes  beyond the  Ctrl-Z  EOF are  also
  summed.

  Example:

      0A>SUM MYFILE
      51639     1
      0A>
