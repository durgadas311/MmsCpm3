CP/NET on CP/M 3 uses an RSX named NDOS3, encapsulated
into NDOS3.COM. This includes both the NDOS and SNIOS.
Different network hardware requires different SNIOS.

To create NDOS3.COM:

1. Build NDOS3.REL (if not already done)
2. Build SNIOSxxx.REL for desired network hardware
3. LINK NDOS3=NDOS3,SNIOSxxx[OP]
4. REN NDOS3.RSX=NDOS3.PRL
5. GENCOM NDOS3 [NULL]

The above steps may require manual removal of NDOS3
components from prior builds (typically NDOS3.RSX
and/or NDOS3.COM)

SNIOS3.ASM	For the virtual CPNetDevice.
SNIOS3422.ASM	For MMS 77422 MagNet board.
SNIOSUSB.ASM	For Norberto's H-89 USB/SERIAL board
		(may be used for H-8 USB by changing port number).
SNIOS000.ASM	Stub (non-functional) SNIOS used
		to create a CP/NET-only version of NTPDATE.

NTPDATE also requires linking with an SNIOS, or at least
SNIOS000. If linked with a working SNIOS, it may be used
without CP/NET. Linking is simply:

	LINK NTPDATE=NTPDATE,SNIOSxxx[OC]
